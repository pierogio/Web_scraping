## What is the project about.
In this project we realized:
Basic webscraping on "http://quotes.toscrape.com," using BeautifulSoup which is a Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. In this context, it helps extract and manipulate data from the website's HTML content.
Basic webscraping on "https://www.bolsamadrid.es," using both BeautifulSoup and Selenium, is a web testing tool that can also be used for web scraping.
Finally, scraping on Amazon webpage is realized using Selenium and Scrapy. Scrapy is an open-source and powerful web scraping framework for Python. It provides a framework and a set of tools to extract data from websites, making it a popular choice for web scraping and crawling tasks.
